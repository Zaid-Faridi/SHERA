</div>

SHEra is a comprehensive, next-generation healthcare platform designed to assist women in the early detection, tracking, and ongoing management of **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)** and **Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD)**.

Built with a premium, modern, and calming UI, SHEra bridges the gap between daily health tracking and advanced medical diagnostics, bringing professional-grade AI analysis directly to users in a safe, secure, and user-friendly environment.

## 🌟 The Problem & The Solution

**The Problem:** PCOS affects up to 10-15% of women worldwide, yet it remains significantly underdiagnosed. Many women struggle with fragmented health tracking apps, delayed diagnoses, and lack of access to specialized medical advice. 

**The Solution:** SHEra consolidates the entire ecosystem of women's reproductive health into a single platform. It uses dual-model Artificial Intelligence (Clinical + Imaging) to provide a highly accurate preliminary risk assessment, while offering daily tracking and community support to help manage the condition long-term.

## ✨ Core Features & Modules

### 1. 🤖 Multi-Modal AI Diagnostic Hub
The heart of SHEra is its proprietary AI engine. It evaluates both clinical history and medical imaging simultaneously.
*   **Clinical Analysis (Tabular Random Forest):** Evaluates a 41-feature clinical matrix.
*   **Symptom Mapping:** Tracks physical symptoms (acne, hair loss, hirsutism, weight gain) and cycle regularity.
*   **Hormonal Metrics:** Evaluates hormonal balances (FSH, LH, AMH).
*   **Vitals:** Incorporates blood pressure, glucose, and body metrics (BMI, Waist:Hip Ratio).
*   **Lab Report Integration:** Users can optionally input exact clinical lab metrics. Unprovided features fallback to intelligent population medians to ensure accuracy without forcing users to have immediate lab results.
*   **Ultrasound Analysis (CNN):** A deep Convolutional Neural Network visually inspects pelvic ultrasound scans for ovarian cysts.
*   **Weighted AI Fusion Scoring:** Merges outputs (`Clinical Data 60%` + `Visual Scan 40%`) into a unified, highly accurate risk score.
*   **Severity-Tiered Classification:** Seamlessly classifies risk into stages (`PCOS Likely`, `PCOS/PCOD Possible`, `Low Risk - Monitor`, `Normal`).

### 2. 🔍 Explainable AI & Trust
We believe AI in healthcare must be transparent.
*   **Grad-CAM Heatmaps:** Generates a visual heatmap overlay on ultrasound uploads.
*   **Visual Proof:** Highlights exactly which regions of the ultrasound (e.g., specific enlarged follicles) triggered the AI's detection.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Provides an exact confidence percentage and clinical severity level.

### 3. 🛡️ Smart Ultrasound Image Guardrail
A built-in safety mechanism to ensure the AI isn't fed junk data.
*   **Grayscale Dominance Check:** Rejects colorful photos (like selfies).
*   **Background Ratio Check:** Evaluates pixel darkness to confirm authentic medical imaging characteristics.
*   **Real-time Rejection:** Returns immediate API feedback if a user uploads a document or landscape photo instead of an ultrasound.

### 4. 📝 Premium Clinical Onboarding
A beautiful, interactive profile builder that creates a complete health baseline.
*   **Demographics:** Age, height, weight (with automated BMI calculation).
*   **Medical History:** Past conditions, pregnancy history.
*   **Lifestyle Assessment:** Diet, exercise, and stress levels.
*   **Symptom Check:** Detailed toggles for irregular cycles, hair loss, skin darkening, etc.

### 5. 📄 Exportable Clinical PDF Reports
Take your data to your doctor.
*   **Instant PDF Generation:** Converts the AI risk assessment into a branded, print-ready document.
*   **Comprehensive Summary:** Includes the risk score, patient demographics, and actionable next steps.
*   **Dynamic Binding:** Automatically fetches the user's name, age, and test timestamp.

### 6. 📊 Interactive Health Tracker
A daily digital diary tailored for reproductive health.
*   **Cycle Tracking:** Log menstrual cycle dates with intelligent future predictions.
*   **Mood Logging:** Tag daily moods using a responsive emoji selector.
*   **Symptom Flare-ups:** Record daily symptoms to track patterns over time.
*   **Diagnostic History:** Securely saves all past AI evaluations to track your risk trajectory.

### 7. 💬 Anonymous Social Community
A built-in supportive forum.
*   **Share & Connect:** Share personal experiences, ask questions, and offer advice.
*   **Categorized Tags:** Filter by `#Diet`, `#MentalHealth`, `#TTC` (Trying to Conceive), `#Workouts`.
*   **Upvotes & Comments:** Foster an encouraging digital environment.

### 8. 🩺 Find a Specialist Directory
*   **Geospatial Search:** Suggests nearby gynecologists and endocrinologists.
*   **Distance Calculation:** Uses the Haversine formula based on the user's location.
